The player uses wasd keys to change the angle of the ship and the spacebar to propel themselves, forward. The player presses the k key to shoot missiles at enemies.
Enemies come in a variety of sprites and get faster and more frequent as you progress through levels. To go from one level to another a player must beat a certain amount of alien ships. When they destroy 10 ships they are transported from one galaxy to another. After they complete 3 levels they are truly put into the infinite bounds space, endless mode. In this mode, players destroy alien ships until they lose. For a player to lose, one of 2 things must happen, they collide with a spaceship, or if they are not in endless mode when the timer of 30 seconds runs out.
